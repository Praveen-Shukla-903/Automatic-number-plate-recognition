# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System

This project is an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system that uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and recognize vehicle number plates from images or video streams. The system can be used for various applications such as security, toll collection, and traffic management.

## Features

- Detects vehicle number plates in images and video streams.
- Extracts and recognizes the text from number plates.
- Supports multiple image formats and video inputs.
- Configurable for different regions and plate formats.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras (if using a custom model)
- **Other Tools**: Flask (for web deployment), SQLite/MySQL (for database management)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anpr-system.git
    cd anpr-system
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the pre-trained models (if any) and place them in the `models` directory.

## Usage

1. **Running the ANPR System**:
    - For image input:
        ```bash
        python anpr.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
        ```
    - For video input:
        ```bash
        python anpr.py --video path/to/your/video.mp4
        ```

2. **Web Interface**:
    - Start the web server:
        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```
    - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Configuration

- **Config File**: Edit `config.yaml` to change the settings such as the threshold for plate detection, OCR settings, and more.
- **Region and Format**: Update the system to recognize number plates specific to your region by modifying the character set and plate format rules.

## Examples

- **Image Detection**:
    ![Example Image](path/to/example/image.jpg)

- **Video Detection**:
    ![Example Video](path/to/example/video.gif)
